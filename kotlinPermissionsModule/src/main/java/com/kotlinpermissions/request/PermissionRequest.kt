 * Used to check the status of a permission.

 * The result of the check is notified on the listeners attached to the [PermissionRequest].
 * To avoid memory leaks, it's recommended to remove the attached listeners when the
 * instance that holds this [PermissionRequest] is destroyed or to build the [PermissionRequest]
 * in a method always executed during the instance's lifecycle.
 *
 * E.g. considering an [Activity] that wants to check the status of a permission when
 * an action is done by the user, it's recommended to build the request at [Activity.onCreate]
 * and send it when the action is done instead of build and send it at the same moment.
 * This could avoid a potential memory leak when the [Activity] is rotated.
